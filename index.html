      <h2>How to leverage a synergy</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name's Dr Archimedes Einstein and I'm a Doctor of Science at the University of Science in a
        very famous town that you're too stupid to have heard of. Anyway, today we're going to talk about
        "synergies". A lot of people are worried about synergies, but I can tell you that statistics show
        there is no danger of increased cancer risk from synergies. However, it's better to be safe than
        sorry. I'm going to demonstrate how you how we can leverage a synergy.
      </p>
      <p>First of all, I've got this banana. This banana represents "Web 2.0" and look, I've written on it
        some "user-generated content" just to prove the point [LOL, WTF, You suck]. I take my "Web 2.0" and
        I put it in an envelope marked "paradigm shift". OK. Very important, I put the envelope down and
        With a bit of "blue sky thinking", I "push the envelope". Then, I take my leverage mallet, and URGH!
        GRRAHH!! YARRRR!!!! ...and there we can see a synergy, leveraged.
