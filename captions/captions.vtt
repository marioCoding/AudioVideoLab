Hi, my name's Dr. Archimedes Einstein,

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.600
and I'm a doctor of science at the University of Science in a very famous town

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.360
that you are too stupid to have heard of. Anyway,

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.200
today we're gonna talk about synergies.

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.080
A lot of people are worried about synergies,

6
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.600
but I can tell you that statistics show there is no danger increased cancer risk

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.880
from synergies. However, better to be safe than sorry.

8
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.880
I'm gonna demonstrate how we can leverage a synergy. First of all,

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.080
I've got this banana. This banana represents Web 2.0. Look,

10
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.120
I've written on it, some user generated content just to prove the point.

11
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.800
I take my web 2.0 and I put in envelope marked paradigm shift.

12
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.880
Okay? Very important.

13
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.480
Now I put the envelope and with a bit of blue sky thinking,

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.040
I'm gonna push the envelope, then I'll take my leverage mallone. Ah.

15
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.040
And there we can see as synergy leveraged.
